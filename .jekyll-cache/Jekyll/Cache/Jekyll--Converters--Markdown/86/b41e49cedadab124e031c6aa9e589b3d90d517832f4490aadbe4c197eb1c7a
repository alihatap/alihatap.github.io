<p>I defended my thesis last November with many expectations. I am looking for a post-doc position where I can thrive and learn.</p>

<h2 id="now">now</h2>
<p>The post I am interested in is a digital humanities job. I am passionate about coding (or trying to code), I have still a lot to learn. After I have gained a certain independence to understand what might go wrong while coding, I have started (recently, finally I have some time after my phd) to work on self-imposed projects to improve my skills. Itâ€™s been less than a month that I have been working on a gamified and simple-to-use vocabulary app. It will take some time to come out! But I believe that if I can show something in my application for this post-doc, my chances will be higher. Thatâ€™s where this blog comes in. In the beginning of my phd, I was hosting my Jekyll-generated blog on GitHub, but later I got discouraged and migrated it to Google Blogger. Itâ€™s been sometime that I am not very happy with the design options on Blogger. This looked like the best moment to return to Jekyll and GitHub, showing my interest in digital humanities and skills in coding, however limited.</p>
