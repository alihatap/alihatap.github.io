### About me
Previously a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie doctoral fellow**,[^1] I recently completed my PhD in **British history** and **history of science** with a [thesis](/about/thesis/) on the amateur scientific associations in **Victorian Britain**.[^2] Subscribing to the 'spatial turn' in the history of science, I investigated the impact of geography in the organisation and practice of **natural history in the English Midlands**. Through an analysis of the natural history societies, naturalists' field clubs and literary and philosophical societies in this hitherto little studied region, my thesis seeks to put the Midlands on the map of Victorian amateur science.

My previous international academic training spanning four countries has provided me with an interdisciplinary background.[^3][^4] 
Working primarily in the social history of science, I am also keenly interested in:
* historical geographies of Victorian Britain
* digital history
* gender studies
* history of scientific illustrations
* periodical studies

### Current projects

I am currently working on several articles derived from my doctoral research. Furthermore, I am writing new research projects in line with my interests listed above. 


### Teaching

My teaching experience focuses mainly on British history from the early modern period to the twentieth century at undergraduate level. In the last two years of my doctoral studies, I was recruited as a Research and Teaching Fellow ([ATER](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attach%C3%A9_temporaire_d%27enseignement_et_de_recherche))[^5] at [Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Cultures Anglophones](https://larca.u-paris.fr/en/home/), Université de Paris. During this time, I also had the chance to design my own course entitled **Science, Culture, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Britain** for second-year undergraduate students.

Furthermore, I taught English grammar in practice at Université Paris 8 in the Spring semester of 2019 as a part-time instructor.
